# Emotion Recognition from Audio (ERA)

## Project Overview
Emotion Recognition from Audio (ERA) is an innovative project that classifies human emotions from speech using advanced machine learning techniques. The frontend is built with Next.js, and the backend uses Flask. The project leverages datasets such as RAVDESS, CREMA-D, TESS, and SAVEE to train an Artificial Neural Network to detect and classify various emotional states from audio inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Various Python libraries for data processing and neural network implementation
